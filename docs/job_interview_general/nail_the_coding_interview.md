# General Method

## Write down the question (1 min)
## Ask questions (5 Min)
1) Does the method accept null
2) How big the integer can be
3) Can we use pop and push method of arry
4) What API are availabgle for this problem
5) Should I optimize for time or space
6) What is the expection of time and space complexities ?
7) They expect to challange thier assumptions by asking good questions.
8) Number to english:
   9) What is the range of number
   10) Can the input be negative
   11) Can the input be fractional
   12) Does the output have dash
    
## Have Test cases (5 Min)
1) have test case ready before coding
   1..9 -> one...nine
   10...19 -> ten...nineteen
   20,30,90 -> twenty, thirthy, ninghty
   21 -> twenty one
   100 -> one hundred.
2) Write test cases as thoroghuly as possible.
3) Include common use cases and edge cases

## Step 4: Describe and write down the algorithm (15 min)
- Array
- LinkedList
- Stack
- HashMap
- Tree
- Heap
- Graph

- Form clear idea before implementation. 
- Best on the test case craft a solution with appropiate DS.
- Example: Convert english 
  - Before number 20 all words are uniqe words - use hash map
- Strategy 
- Choose an appropiate algorithm
- Describe your thinking
- Analyze

## Step 5: Start coding (5 min)
1) Translate the algorithm into code
2) Fix bugs and syntax errors on your own

## Step 6 : Test (5 min)
Test the code using Step 3. 
Test every code branch

# Conculusion
- Evaluated communication, requierment gathering, data structure, algorithm, testing
- Read the choke book from the library.

# Examples
### Question
 Move all zero to the left
### Test case
 - Regular
 - All zero array
 - None Zero array
 - No change array
 - Zero on the other size
