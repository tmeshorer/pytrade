# Overview
- Store freq access data close to the processor
- Principle of locality
- Cache hit / Cache miss
## Benefits
- Fast access
- Reduce latency
- Bandwidth optimization
- Improved troughput
## Cache eviction policy
- Max cach hit ratio
- Queue based policy
  - FIFO
  - LIFO
- Recency based policy
  - LRU
  - MRU (Most recently used)
- AllowList - Set of predefined items elgible for retention. 
- Invalidation
  - TTL
  - Invalid on modification
  - Invalid on read
- Caching strategy
- Caching deployment
  - In process caching - in memory data
  - Inter process caching - deploying the cache as a seperate process.
  - Inter process caching - Deploy the cache as a seperate process
  - Remote cache.
- Where?
  - CDN Cache
    - Push CDN - content is pre cached in advance
    - Pull CDN - content is pull on demand
  - Web server cache
  - Database Caching
  - Qeury Level Caching - result of freq query
  - Object level caching
- Multi tier CDN
- Geo DNS
