  - Vertical parition
  - Horizonal Parition
  - Hash Parition
  - Range parition
- Sharding
  - Distobite large database across mulitple servers
- Replication
  - Copy data from one server to another. Each node stores a replica
    - High Availability
    - Load Distribution
    - Reduce latency
    - DR
    - Scalability - Horizontal scaling
  - Single leaderr / Multi leader
    - Single leader - one database is the leader.
  - Sync replication
