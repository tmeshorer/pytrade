# Program dev cycle
- understand the problem
- plan the logic
  - plan the step of the program.
  - flowchart and psuado code.
  - desk checking - 
- code the program
- compile
- test the program
  - execute it with sample data.

# Data on a compute
- literal / variable / consts
- literal
  - numeric - 43/43.4
  - string - "tom"

- variable
  - name
  - datatype
  - assigning value using assignment operatror
  - magic number
  - aritmtic operation


# module 
- program call a module.
- functional decomposition
- name modile like name vairble

# Program structure
- decleration
- house keeping
- main loop () // one or more time
- end of jok
- create hirarcy chart

# Structure
- seq
- selection
- loop

## Seq
- perfrom action in order

## Selection
- make a decision
- if cond == true:
-   A
  else
-   B
# Loop
- while you continue to by hungry:
  - take bite of food
- question + statement
- Each time the question get asked again.
- Structured loop:
  - ask the question
  - if the answer indicate that you need to execute the body do it
  - ask the question again
  - first steps are priming steps.
  - 
# Making decision
- Each decision that a program make is boolean expression. 
- two parts: if-then cluse
- else cluse
- Use Relational compression
- == / > / < 
- AND condition
- OR condition
- Not condition
- Make selection within ranges
- Make selection on each value

# Lopping
- Define loop control variable.
- You might increment or decrement the loop control varaible
- Loop:
  - You must provide value for the loop control var
  - Your test the loop control var to derimine if we should exit
  - Within the loop alter the loop control vairble.
  - while
    - control var must start with 0
    - control var must be tested
    - body must alter 
- Common loop mistakes:
  - Forgeting to initlize the loop control var
  - Neglecting to alter the loop control var 
- Differece between loop and selection
  - Both structure start with boolean expression
  - Both structre have body if expression is true
  - In loop , after the body, the body return to the original question.
  - In selection its not.

# Array
- Series or list of data values
- 

# Algorithm
Imperative - description of set of steps with flow of control that specify when each step to
be executed . Provided a set of input will produce the output.
- Program stored as data.
- Both program and data resides in memory.
- To create a recipe we need a programming lang.
- Python have scalar types:
  - int
  - float
  - bool
  - None
- use operator to form expression 3+2
- variable associate name with object.
```yaml
pi = 3
```
- assignment statment associate the name to the var.
- conditiona statment
  - test
  - true block
  - false block
- String represent string of chars.
  - length of string
  - string indexing
  - Slicing
- Loping :
  - test -> loop body.
- 

# Predicate

# Sets
- Set - unorder collection of uniqe value
- Person = {alice,bob...}
## operation
- Union - smosh set into one big thing
- intersect - find the common elements
- take difference - substract one set from another

## Map / Filter
- Map - apply value to each function in the set {x^2 for x in set}
- Filter - { x in set : x>2 }


# Logic and specification
- Correct function does what its expected to do.
