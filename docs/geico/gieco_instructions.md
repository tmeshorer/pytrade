- Problem navigation:  You should be asking questions to reduce ambiguity, 
  - identify the most critical problems, 
  - understand what is needed for quantitative analysis, and define a requirement set to design to.
- Solution Design:
  - Big picture of the design
  - Single point of failure
  - Vision and technical ideas.
- Way
  - Outline high level components
  - How they fit together
- Question:
  - How many users
  - How many peak users
  - What are the latency requiment
  - What features we would support.
- 
Performance -How fast is the system?

- Scalability - How will the system respond to increased demand?
- Reliability - What is the systemâ€™s uptime?
- Resilience - How will the system recover if it fails?
- Security - How are the system and data protected?
- Usability - How do users interact with the system?
- Observability/Maintainability - How will you troubleshoot the system?

    - Migration
  - Design a system that copy a file to one machine
    - File is 100GB 
    - once day - 100K target machine on the moon.
    - 100 MB - 10000 sec to transfer data. We cannot transfer from our source machine
    - Totoal bandwidth available. 
    - How to account which machine recieve the data - extra network latency. 
    - 
- What are the bottle neck in the system
  - Network bandwith
  - Disk IO bandiwth
  - Disk operations.
  - SSD 0.1 ms 
  - SSD 100K per second.
