# Psudo code

## Name of the program

```yaml
Program CalculateIntrest



END.
```

## Variables
- Algebra 2X-10 -0
- Item contain a value, value change over time.
- Var is like a bucket, put value in the bucket.
### Assignment
```yaml
X <- 5;
X <- X + 1;
Y<- X
```
### Floating point
```yaml
P <- 3.1323
```
### String
```yaml
Vitamin <- 'B'
Pet <- "Dog";
```
### Boolean
```yaml
IsWeekend <- FALSE;
```

### Programs
```yaml
PROGRAM PrintDouble:
  Read Value;
  DoubleValue <- 2 * Value
  Print DoubleValue
```

# Top Down Design
- start at the top
- break to sub steps.

# Sequence
- Start at the top and work your way down
- Decide what to tell the compute first
```yaml
Statement1;
Statement2;
```
- Figure the sequence on which things need to happen

# Selection
- Wish to print recipt (Yes/No) ?
- Give user a choice - IF Statement - Selection
```yaml
IF (suger is required) 
   THEN add sugar;
   ELSE don't add sugar
ENDIF;
```

## Boolean Logic
- IF / CASE / WHILE / FOR 
- `AND` - Both A AND B should be true
```yaml
IF (A == 5 AND AGE[Index] < AGE[INDEX+1])
   THEN x
```
- `OR` Operation , either
- `NOT` Operation
- 

```yaml
IF (A > B) 
   THEN PRINT A;
   ELSE PRINT B;
ENDIF;
```

# Iteration
- Reapting a task over and over again
- Searching a phone book on with selection

## WHILE
```yaml
Get first entry;
Entry <- Entry;
WHILE (N is NOT entry)
   DO Get Next entry;
ENDWHILE
```
### FOR loop
- Range
```yaml
FOR A IN 1 TO 5
  DO Print A;    
```
```yaml
FOR VALUE IN RANGE
   DO
```



```yaml
WHILE (CONDITION)
  DO <Statement>;
ENDWHILE
```

## Array
### Declare
```
Integer Age[40]
```
### Assign
```yaml
Age[4] <- 53
```


# Advance data structure

## Linked List
- Array is static
- [Value,Link]
- [Value,Null] - Last value.
- Add Value
- Delete Value

## Tree
- Each node have three part
- Value / Left / Right
- Top most value is called the Root.
- Binary Tree - 0 / 1 / 2 sub values.

## Stack 
- Stack of pages.
- Add to the top and take from the top.
